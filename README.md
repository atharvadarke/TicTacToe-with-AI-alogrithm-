# TicTacToe-with-AI-alogrithm-
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a twist â€” an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures optimal moves, making it a challenging game for any human player. The game is designed for a single-player experience where the user competes against the computer.
